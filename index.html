                    Hello! My name is James Stimac, and I originally studied at UNC Chapel Hill where gained a love for languages.
                    This love extended after my graduation in 2020 to a love for learning coding languages as well. I soon found 
                    the program at SNHU where I studied Game Programming and Development.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                Within the different pages of this website are different artifacts created during my time at SNHU. These artifacts
                range from python programs to projects created in Unreal Engine 4 and 5. They are shown here to indicate the
                varied aspects of game programming I was exposed to. These artifacts also follow a common focus on coding. In my 
                final year at SNHU, I was able to focus on Gameplay Engineering as a potential role through my final course. This 
                led me to create experiences within Unreal Engine that focused on aspects of gameplay as well as the integrations of
                other fields within game development that gameplay engineers combine to create a cohesive experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                To showcase my skillset, I have curated four artifacts for this portfolio. The first artifact is a text-based game
                created in python that I am working on porting to a website with standalone graphics and gameplay. Currently it is
                still in its text-based format; however, this will allow me to easily transform the text-based logic into the backbone
                of the final iteration. To view gameplay as well as the base code navigate to the <a href="py_game.html">Standalone</a> tab.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second, third, and fourth artifacts for this portfolio were created in Unreal. The second showcases different forms of
                interactive and <a href="hud_game.html">HUD</a>s for a treasure hunting game prototype built utilizing Blueprints within UE4. 
                The third, built in UE5, showcases a rudimentary <a href="ai_game.html">AI</a> that travels around the map explaining how to 
                play the game. The fourth artifact generates a <a href="terrain_game.html">terrain</a> using triangles and utilizing the native
                shaders of the engine. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Soon I will be working on new solo projects to expand this portfolio with. The major take-away I have gained from my time at
                SNHU is that continual progresss, even if it is miniscule, is always worth it. While studying at this university, I was able
                to learn about multiple different coding languages as well as different APIs and best practices for those languages. I still
                have much to learn when it comes to more complex issues like shaders and AI; however, I have learned that these courses are
                just the first step to my development as a program developer.
